# DispensoryMod for Rimworld

Gives the player more control over drug use in game.

Adds the objects:

    **Dispensary**
        Links to a stockpile to provide drugs to pawns that are authorised to use them via the vanilla drug policy system.
        This building fits on to a wall and blocks access to this protected stockpile.

    **Drug Room Door**
        A special door that blocks access to pawns assigned to specific drug policies.
        This can be used to keep at-risk pawns out of the protected drug stockpile.
        Beware though! anyone can pass the door if it is unpowered (will act like a standard door).
        Unlocked with the reasarch 'Autodoors'
