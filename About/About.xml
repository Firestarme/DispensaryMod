  <description>1.4.1.0 [04-10-23]

Gives the player more control over drug use in game.

Adds the objects:

**Dispensary**
    Links to a stockpile to provide drugs to pawns that are authorised to use them via the vanilla drug policy system.
    This building fits on to a wall and blocks access to this protected stockpile.

**Drug Room Door**
    A special door that blocks access to pawns assigned to specific drug policies.
    This can be used to keep at-risk pawns out of the protected drug stockpile.
    Beware though! anyone can pass the door if it is unpowered (will act like a standard door).
    Unlocked with the reasarch 'Autodoors'
